PHY 001 is a two-quarter sequence requiring some mathematics (trigonometry). Either PHY 001A alone or both quarters may be taken. The sequence is not intended to satisfy entrance requirements of a year of physics for professional schools, but will satisfy requirements of 3 or 6 units of physics. PHY 007 is a one-year (three-quarter) introductory physics course with laboratory intended for students majoring in the biological sciences. It has a calculus prerequisite. If you don't want a full year of introductory physics, you should take one or two quarters of PHY 001, instead. Read the following information carefully if you are using PHY to complete an introductory course you have already begun. If you have completed one introductory quarter or semester of a traditionally taught physics course and want to continue with PHY 007, you will probably have full or partial credit for PHY 007B. You should first take (and will receive full credit for) PHY 007A. Then, if you have received partial credit for PHY 007B, you can take the remainder of the course using PHY 049 (please see the department for details), or take PHY 007B and receive reduced credit. Finally, take PHY 007C for full credit. If you have completed one introductory quarter or semester of a traditionally taught physics course and want to continue with PHY 007, you should first take (and will receive full credit for) PHY 007A. Then, either skip PHY 007B, but self-study the last three weeks of material, or take PHY 007B and receive reduced credit. Finally, take PHY C for full credit. If you have taken two quarters of a year-long introductory physics course and have not had extensive work in optics, electricity and magnetism, and modern physics, you should take PHY 007C. In no case should you take PHY B without first taking PHY 007A. All other situations should be discussed directly with a PHY 007 instructor. Students not intending to take the entire sequence should instead take PHY 001. PHY 009 is a four-quarter sequence using calculus throughout and including laboratory work as an integral component. The course is primarily for students in the physical sciences and engineering. PHY 009H is a five-quarter honors physics sequence, which may be taken instead of PHY 009. It is intended primarily for first-year students with a strong interest in physics and with advanced placement in mathematics to MAT 021B. Students who plan to major in physics, and also motivated non-majors, should take PHY 009H instead of PHY 009 if they are ready to begin MAT 021B in fall quarter. In course requirements and prerequisites, PHY HA-009HE can be substituted for PHY 009A-009D. Students may not switch between the PHY 009H and PHY series beyond PHY 009HA or PHY 009A.
